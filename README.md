# Ghostboi in the Land of the Dead
"Ghostboi in the Land of the Dead" is an alternative controller game about a ghost that experiences an existential crisis in the afterlife.

The game is powered by a Raspberry Pi and uses the PyGame and RPi.GPIO libraries. 

The controller is made out of silicone rubber, is shaped like a ghost and is embedded with tilt switches and capacitive touch sensors. The game is displayed on a small screen, where the player can see how their handling of the controller orients the ghost character.
